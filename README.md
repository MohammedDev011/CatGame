# CatGame

CatGame is a dynamic, Java-based game developed in 2023 using the JOGL library for 3D OpenGL graphics, set in an urban environment where players navigate a cat to avoid cars and collect food for points. Featuring interactive gameplay with keyboard controls ('w', 's', 'a', 'd', 'r'), a challenging scoring system, and immersive sound effects via the Java Sound API, the game offers a rich graphical experience with detailed terrains and animated elements. To play, clone the repository, import it into Eclipse, link the JOGL libraries, and run CatGame.java. Contributions and enhancements are encouraged!
